This directory contains sound effect files for the FABRI Calculator.

The following audio files should be placed here:
1. click.mp3 - Sound effect for button clicks
2. hover.mp3 - Sound effect for button hover
3. theme.mp3 - Sound effect for theme changes
4. modal.mp3 - Sound effect for modal open/close
5. error.mp3 - Sound effect for error messages
6. success.mp3 - Sound effect for successful calculations

These audio files should be short (less than 1 second) and have a clean, professional sound that matches the premium feel of the calculator.

For optimal user experience, the audio files should be:
- Low latency (quick to play)
- Consistent in volume
- Distinct from each other
- Not distracting or annoying

Note: Since we can't directly create audio files in this environment, you'll need to source appropriate sound files and place them in this directory.
