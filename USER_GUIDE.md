### Trigonometric Functions

- **sin**: Calculates the sine of an angle in degrees
- **cos**: Calculates the cosine of an angle in degrees
- **tan**: Calculates the tangent of an angle in degrees

Note: All trigonometric functions use degrees, not radians. For example:
- sin(90Â°) = 1
- cos(90Â°) = 0

- tan(90Â°) will show "Undefined" (as it should)

### Constants

- **Ï€** (Pi): Inserts the value of Ï€ (approximately 3.14159...)
- **e**: Inserts the value of e (approximately 2.71828...)

### Example: Scientific Calculation

To calculate sin(30Â°):
1. Press 3, 0
2. Press sin
3. Result: 0.5 appears in the display

To calculate cos(60Â°):
1. Press 6, 0
2. Press cos
3. Result: 0.5 appears in the display

To calculate tan(45Â°):
1. Press 4, 5
2. Press tan
3. Result: 1 appears in the display

To calculate âˆš25:
1. Press 2, 5
2. Press âˆš
3. Result: 5 appears in the display

## Memory Functions

### Storing and Recalling Values

- **STO** (Store): Stores the current value in memory
- **RCL** (Recall): Recalls the value from memory to the current display
- **M+** (Memory Add): Adds the current value to the memory
- **M-** (Memory Subtract): Subtracts the current value from the memory
- **ANS**: Inserts the result of the previous calculation

### Example: Using Memory

To store a value and use it later:
1. Calculate or enter a value (e.g., 42)
2. Press STO to store it in memory
3. Perform other calculations
4. Press RCL to recall the stored value (42)

To accumulate values in memory:
1. Enter 10, press M+ (adds 10 to memory)
2. Enter 20, press M+ (adds 20 to memory, total now 30)
3. Enter 5, press M- (subtracts 5 from memory, total now 25)
4. Press RCL to display the memory value (25)

## Tips and Tricks

### Efficient Calculations

1. **Use ANS for Chained Calculations**: After getting a result, you can immediately perform another operation on it without re-entering the number.

2. **Memory for Intermediate Results**: Store intermediate results in memory when performing complex multi-step calculations.

3. **Keyboard for Speed**: Use your keyboard for faster input, especially when entering multiple calculations.

### Display Management

1. **Scroll Long Results**: If a result is too long for the display, use the arrow button (â†’) to scroll through it. The calculator supports both left and right scrolling directions.

2. **Choose the Right Theme**: The Matrix theme (green) is easier on the eyes in low light, while the Pure theme (white) offers better contrast in bright environments.

3. **History Tracking**: Look at the history display above the main display to keep track of your calculation sequence.
